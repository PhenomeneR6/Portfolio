    "Hello and welcome to my portfolio !\n\nMy name is Théo 'Phenomene' Hentgen. 29 years old and currently living in France.\n\nMy past experiences in Europe, Asia and North America have led me to work in three different languages and work with different cultures. I am currently looking for an opportunity to work as a coach in any region, as I am able to relocate anywhere in the world. I can speak French, English and i am currently learning portuguese.\n\nI have been playing football (or soccer, if you're from North America) for 20 years. I have been the captain of all my teams and this is where I started to build a strong leadership.\n\nI have a degree in Sports with Physical, Mental, and Psychological courses. I also have a master in Esports Communication.\n\nI have now been a Siege coach for 6 years, you'll find all my past experiences in said category.\n\nHere, you'll find everything you need to know about myself, do not hesitate to contact me if you want to know more !"
